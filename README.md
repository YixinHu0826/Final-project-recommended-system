# Final-project-recommended-system
# Introduction 
Our project is a movel recommendation system with data collection and processing to complile movie data base on a real public website,including details such as title, director, actors, genre, rating, etc., as well as users' historical viewing records and ratings. This data is then cleaned, removing duplicates and handling missing values. Next, appropriate recommendation algorithms, such as content-based, collaborative filtering, and deep learning, are selected and implemented. Python's machine learning and deep learning libraries are utilized to train and optimize the recommendation models based on users' viewing records, ratings, and movie characteristics. Additionally, user profiling and interest modeling are developed to gain insights into users' interests, preferences, and behavior patterns, utilizing machine learning libraries in Python. A user-friendly interactive interface is designed, enabling users to easily search, browse, and watch movies while receiving real-time personalized recommendations. This interface can be developed using Python's web framework or GUI library. Finally, the recommendation system is evaluated and optimized by analyzing performance metrics like accuracy, recall rate, and coverage rate. User feedback and behavior data are collected to further enhance the recommendation algorithm and model, improving the overall efficacy of the system.
